Regardless of the source, we believe it’s important to treat that information with care and to help you maintain your privacy.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-collect">What we collect</h2>
<p>Search. When you conduct a search, the Services will collect the search terms you provide. We will use the search terms to search local and third party products and services, such as Google.com, and Bing.com.</p>

<h2 id="onedrive-integration">OneDrive Integration.</h2>
<p>The Services with OneDrive integration, may store the collected content details on your OneDrive.</p>

<h2 id="signing-in">Signing in</h2>
<p>To access some Services, you will need to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which Microsoft refers to as your <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/account">Microsoft account</a>. By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically signed into other Microsoft sites and services that use the Microsoft account. See below for Microsoft privacy information.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-collect">How we collect</h2>

<p>Software installed on your computer or other devices, which may send back information needed to operate, update or improve that software.</p>

<h2 id="storage-and-retention">Storage and Retention</h2>

<p>The Services are provided free of charge because they are supported by advertising. In order to make these services widely available, the information we collect may be used to help improve the advertisements you see by making them more relevant to you.
